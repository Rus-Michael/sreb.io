# Republic оf Rus’
The spelling of the word Rus’ with one letter S symbolizes that we deliberately distance ourselves from the imperial heritage of Russia and see the origins of our history in Rus’

### Capital
Veliky Novgorod

### Flag
White Berquoise White

### Coin
Srebrenik (Srebrenik) SRBK

## Black page
We categorically condemn the war unleashed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. Anyone who started this war, commits war crimes or supports it in any way should not escape retribution.

## Development priorities
Education, science, harmonious development of personality, rational and careful use of natural resources.

## The time of halftones, omissions and doubts has passed - it's time to act.
Our strategy is quite simple. We begin to develop the project of the new Republic of Rus’ completely ignoring Putin's criminal power, and define it as having completely lost its legitimacy. 
We are ready to defend our freedom and the right to self-determination. 
We strive for maximum decentralization of power and minimization of the participation of state institutions in any realm of activity, as far as possible. 
We invite all caring people to join the project. Independently create working groups of specialists in different realms. Start designing the institutions of the new Republic of Rus'. Spread projects on the Internet, argue, discuss, negotiate. We will need a draft constitution for the new Republic of Rus', decentralized electronic voting systems, and more. It's time to act!

## Origins
We see the origins of our history and traditions in Kievan Rus’ and the Novgorod Republic. We reject the traditions of authoritarian power imposed by the Ulus of the Golden Horde. We rely on the spirit of democracy and the principles of civil self-organization; whose historical origins originate from the Veliky Novgorod Republic. We do not see historical greatness in imperial ambitions and traditions of slavish admiration for power, but we are looking for sources of inspiration in the achievements of science, technology, arts and free crafts.

## Currency
We are launching the crypto coin Srebrenik (Srebrenik) SRBK, which should become the prototype of the money of the future Republic of Rus’ and will be exchangeable or will be used indirectly as a legal means of payment.
At this stage, we believe that it would be appropriate to use the SRBK coin in a decentralized e-voting system. The gist of the idea is as follows: When participating in voting on any significant issue, using a decentralized voting system, the voting participant pays a kind of “representation tax”, thus the principle of “No taxation without representation” is implemented. From the collected funds, a reward is paid to the group that proposed the draft document for voting.
